This whitepaper provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-DEATE workflow, starting with the utilization of the AI-DEATE Prompt Generator and concluding with the creation of multiple images using AI-DEATE's customized diffusion models.

**Introduction:**
In today's fast-paced advertising industry, clients demand high-quality visuals that capture their brand identity and resonate with their target audience. Yell Advertising Agency has established itself as a leader in this field by leveraging cutting-edge technology to produce stunning storyboards for their clients. However, the agency was constantly looking for ways to streamline its workflow and reduce production time and costs. This is where AI-DEATE LAB comes in.

**AI-DEATE Workflow:**
The AI-DEATE workflow starts with the use of AI-DEATE Prompt Generator, a tool developed in partnership with RikuAI. This tool generates the perfect prompt to use in AI-DEATE's custom stable diffusion model, taking into account the client's brief concept. This model allows Yell's creative director to select the type of camera, lens, focal length, and focus object that best suits the project, ensuring that the prompt generated is tailored to the specific needs of the project.

The next step involves using the prompt generated from AI-DEATE Prompt Generator to create multiple images using AI-DEATE Diffusion. These custom-trained diffusion models are specifically made for each client, with a focus on bringing out the niche of each brand identity. This includes the niche of the product for the campaign and the niche of the brand ambassador of the campaign. By using these custom models, AI-DEATE LAB can create stunning visuals that capture the essence of their clients' brands.
